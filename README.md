# LineAnimatedCheckBox
Android CheckBox with line animation

## Animations
Checkbox animations all are animated svg (android vector). [This Medium article](https://proandroiddev.com/how-to-animate-on-android-f8d227135613) is helpful for animations on android.
<br />
<br />
Thanks to android support appcompat library, Animated Vectors can run on android api < 21.<br />
But some of phones have some bug on running Animated Vectors (can not run parallel Object Animators). <br />
[RichPath](https://github.com/tarek360/RichPath) let you access svg paths on the code and also let you animate them by java codes.

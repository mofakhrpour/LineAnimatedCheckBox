# LineAnimatedCheckBox
Android CheckBox with line animation

<br />

## Tools used
AdobeXD for making svg file ([project file](https://github.com/mofakhrpour/LineAnimatedCheckBox/blob/master/svg/Adobe%20XD%20(Svg).xd))
<br />
ShapeShifter for animating svg ([shapeshifter.design](https://shapeshifter.design)) ([project file](https://github.com/mofakhrpour/LineAnimatedCheckBox/blob/master/svg/Vector%20Animation%20(ShapeShifter.design).shapeshifter))

<br />

## Animations
Checkbox animations all are animated svg (android vector). [This Medium article](https://proandroiddev.com/how-to-animate-on-android-f8d227135613) is helpful for animations on android.
<br />
<br />
Thanks to android support appcompat library, Animated Vectors can run on android api < 21.<br />
But some of phones have some bug on running Animated Vectors (can not run parallel Object Animators). <br />
[RichPath](https://github.com/tarek360/RichPath) let you access svg paths on the code and also let you animate them by java codes.

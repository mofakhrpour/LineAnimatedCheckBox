Thanks to android support appcompat library you can use AnimatedVectors on android api < 21
But some of phones have some bug on running AnimatedVectors (can not run parallel ObjectAnimators)
[RichPath](https://github.com/tarek360/RichPath) let you access svg paths on the code and also let you animate them by java codes
